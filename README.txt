a rust tool to poke at IT8987 EC found in x1e80100 machines, including
lenovo yoga slim 7x extensions

notes:
- Lenovo Yoga Slim7x and Honor Magicbook Art 14 seem to have a somewhat-compatible firmware with random extensions
- Microsoft Surface laptops have a completely different firmware
- ThinkPad T14s also has the classic H8 EC found in x86 ThinkPads

unknown things:
- why do some devices reference 0x76, and others 0x36
- why slim7x lid switch doesn't work
